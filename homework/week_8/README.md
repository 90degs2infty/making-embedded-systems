# `micro:bit` template

A minimal RTIC application dumping a set of addresses to examine the linker's work.

Based on https://github.com/rtic-rs/defmt-app-template which is in turn based on https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template

## Dependencies

#### 1. `flip-link`:

```console
$ cargo install flip-link
```

#### 2. `probe-run`:

``` console
$ # make sure to install v0.2.0 or later
$ cargo install probe-rs --features cli
```

## Setup

#### 1. Clone this repository

``` console
$ git clone https://github.com/90degs2infty/making-embedded-systems.git
```

#### 2. Run!

``` console
$ cd $PROJECT_ROOT/homework/week_8
$ DEFMT_LOG=info cargo run
    Finished dev [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.03s
  (...)
```

## Mapfile

Building the application will generate a mapfile in `week-8.map`.
A slightly post-processed file (paths have been "obfuscated") is dumped in [`mapfile.map`](mapfile.map).
Note that to my understanding, the mapfile is generated by the underlying "native" linker (as opposed to `flip-link`), so it does not report the flipped memory layout.
