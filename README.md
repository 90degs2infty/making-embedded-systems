# Making embedded systems

I'm enrolled in the 2023 edition of the [_Making embedded systems_ course](https://classpert.com/classpertx/courses/making-embedded-systems/cohort) by Elecia White.

This repository contains my take at the course's coding assignments.

Note: feel free to look through the code and drop me an issue on open improvements :)
Please be aware though, that (at least for the moment being) I do not take any PRs.

## Assignments

- [Week 3: Blinky](homework/week_3/blinky/)
- [Week 5: CLI](homework/week_5/command-rs/)
