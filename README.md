# Making embedded systems

**Caution:This branch is intended as a brain-dump only.**
**It will likely not get merged to `main` (instead, go to a dedicated repository) and history might get rewritten.**
**So please do not use this branch as of now.**

I'm enrolled in the 2023 edition of the [_Making embedded systems_ course](https://classpert.com/classpertx/courses/making-embedded-systems/cohort) by Elecia White.

This repository contains my take at the course's coding assignments.

Note: feel free to look through the code and drop me an issue on open improvements :)
Please be aware though, that (at least for the moment being) I do not take any PRs.

## Assignments
